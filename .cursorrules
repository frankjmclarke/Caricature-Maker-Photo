# Core Repository Invariants

This is an iOS SwiftUI codebase. These rules always apply.

- Use Swift 5.9+ and SwiftUI best practices
- Prefer value types (struct) and immutable data where practical
- Never store secrets in source code or UserDefaults
- Config.plist is gitignored - never commit API keys
- Keep changes incremental and reviewable
