# Testing Workflow

**Purpose**: Testing patterns, flags, and test organization. Apply when writing or modifying tests.

## Testing Flags
- `forceOnboarding` - Set to true to force onboarding display (set to false for production)
- `forceShowPaywall` - Set to true to force paywall display even if purchased (set to false for production)

## Test Coverage
- Unit-test calculation functions (BMR/TDEE) and status threshold logic
- Write tests for onboarding gating and persistence
- Do not add snapshot testing unless asked
