# Calories Deficit Tracker Domain Rules

**Purpose**: Business logic, calculations, and domain-specific constraints. Defines the app's core philosophy and calculation methods.

## Core Philosophy
- The app is "measurement, not judgment"
- Do not add target weight, coaching, streak pressure, or moral language

## Calculations
- **BMR**: Use Mifflin–St Jeor equation
- **TDEE**: BMR × activity multiplier (internal constants)
- **Display**: Show TDEE using "~" (approximate), no false precision

## Evaluation Logic
- Evaluate "on track" using weekly averages
- Avoid day-to-day volatility in status calculations
