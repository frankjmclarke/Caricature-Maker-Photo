# Onboarding and Paywall Flow

**Purpose**: Rules for onboarding sequence and paywall integration. Apply when working on user onboarding or subscription features.

## Onboarding Logic
- Onboarding shows once only unless `forceOnboarding` is true (testing flag)
- Gate at app root: show onboarding if `forceOnboarding || !hasCompletedOnboarding`
- Onboarding collects user assumptions then shows paywall
- Provide an Assumptions edit screen in Settings

## Paywall Integration
- Uses Superwall for paywall management
- `forceShowPaywall` global variable for testing (set to false for production)
- Paywall shown in onboarding flow via `PaywallView` from SuperwallKit
